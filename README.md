# Ravenous 🥭🥝🍊🥑
**A horror visual novel about a fruit cafe and your mysterious hunger.**

You experience three days, each with no memory of what has happened before, including the previous days that you spent at this cafe. Each day, your hunger amounts until you can no longer stand it. The fruit is never enough.

Made with Renpy for the Parthenon hackathon (Athena Award)!

By Chloe Kershner-Hammond, Shurui Guo, and Shyla Singal
